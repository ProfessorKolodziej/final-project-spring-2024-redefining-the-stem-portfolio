	<p>I am a Ph.D. student under the NDSEG fellowship at MIT Mathematics. Previously, I earned my A.B. in Physics and
		Mathematics at Harvard University.
		Broadly, I work in the theory of quantum information relevant to both the near and far term. In the near term, I
		am interested in quantum machine
		learning and, more generally, quantum algorithms for computation and communication. In the far term, I am
		interested in quantum complexity theory
		and its connections to quantum physics, such as black hole radiation. Outside of research, I enjoy creating
		inventive cocktails, hiking, biking, and traveling.
		You can see some of these in action on my interests page.
